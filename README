Einstein Field Equation solution calculator.

Accepts stress-energy source terms of matter (density, specific internal energy, pressure) and electromagnetism (electric field, magnetic field).
Converges on solution via...
(1) linear solver with solution vector corresponding to stress-energy source terms (which is constantly changing per-iteration, since the stress-energy tensor is based on the metric, which is being solved for)
(2) JFNK solver whose zero is equal to the EFE: G_ab - 8 pi T_ab

goals:
1) verify Newtonian gravity matches Schwarzschild gravity from on to above the surface (check, from solar system project)
2) verify Schwarzschild stellar model gravity due to analytical connection equations is maximal at surface, ->0 as r->0 and r->infinity (check)
3) verify Schwarzschild stellar model gravity due to finite difference matches the analytical connection equation values (still working on this ...)
3.5?) Find a metric within stars with nonzero G_ab = 8 pi T_ab, T_ab = diag(rho, P, P, P).  The current Schwarzschild model treats all matter as a point source, within the radius of the point of evaluation of the metric, and therefore always has G_ab = 0.
	This *might* help the initial conditions, but shouldn't make a difference once numerical solution solving gets working.
4) Get the numerical solution solver to work, and accurately.  Especially for it to start at flat space, given Earth's stress-energy source term, and come up with Earth's gravity, as the Schwarzschild analytical answer already gives us.
